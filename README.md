# DevServerControl
The ultra-light weight control panel for Apache2, PHP and DynamoDB local server.

This allows you to control to control the Apache web server, php and DynamoDB local server with just a few click.

Note: This is only working for WAMP server 64 (https://www.wampserver.com/en/)

You'll need to install root certificate from https://pki.rdto.io/ to trust the certificate. It'll be replaced with an official issued certificate in a few months, I promised. üòÅ
